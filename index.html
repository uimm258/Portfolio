        <h2>Hello, I'm Maymay Liu</h2>
        <p>My real name is Hongni, but I like people calling me Maymay. I currently live in the Bay Area of northern California. I am a computer gamer, which is what got me interested in computer software and web development. I enjoy building my own applications, and I feel fulfilled when I see the result of my completed work. I like to build websites, and my goal is to create sites that are useful and easy to use.</p>

        <p>Keep scrolling down to see more about me :)</p>

    <!--About Me-->
    <section id="About">
      <div class="group">
        <div class="item boxed">
          <h3>Passion to the Web</h3>
          <p style="text-align:left;">  When I created my website for the pre-course, I still remember the feeling I had when making it. It was nice; a feeling of comfort, contentedness like I am an expert in programing already.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="item boxed">
          <h3>Desire to work on a team</h3>
          <p style="text-align:left;">I used to work everything on my own and refuse to communicate with the community. However, after studying at Thinkful and completing some amazing projects with my teammates, I realize the importance of working in a team and the pleasure of always having teammates who can back you up. I am now excited to work on a team with good programmers to have my work completed and learn from them. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="item boxed">
          <h3>Personality outside coding</h3>
          <p style="text-align:left;">I am very optimistic. There is always a solution to a problem, and I don't give up searching for it. One instance that comes to mind was I took CS classes while I was in college and didn't pass two of them. After graduating, I come to Thinkful to pursue my goal because I am passionate about coding. I will find a way to achieve my goal, and I am on my way right now.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="item boxed">
          <h3>Services for the clients</h3>
          <p style="text-align:left;">The most important thing is that I wish I can provide the best solution to the client's request. Meanwhile, I want to present my best energy to all my clients. So, I wish to provide energy and problem-solving skills to the clients.</p>
